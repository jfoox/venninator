To do

1.	First homework:
		a. Create dummy dataset (series of fasta files)
		b. Create "Concatenator" class to concatenate dummy dataset files
		c. C&P some wrapper Biopython script (on git?) to communicate between local BLAST and Venninator
		d. Create a master script to execute concatenator class, then pass database thru wrapper to local BLAST, create a BLAST database, and return "your database has been created"
		 

First class: Concatenate all fasta files
	a.	Save concatenated file as “reference.fa” to be used for local BLAST database
	b.	Print the concatenated file

What wrappers are available to communicate between Local BLAST and Python? (Most have been written to communicate between Python and the BLAST web service)
http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Blast.Applications-module.html

Requires intermediary class: iteratively takes sequence query as object to pass thru wrapper class to the local BLAST, then returns result
	In this class, >> blast[x]_output.txt

2.  Put steps for user in read-me file
