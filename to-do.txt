To do

1.	First class: Concatenate all fasta files
	a.	Save concatenated file as “reference.fa” to be used for local BLAST database
	b.	Print the concatenated file

2.	What wrappers are available to communicate between Local BLAST and Python? (Most have been written to communicate between Python and the BLAST web service)
http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Blast.Applications-module.html

Requires intermediary class: iteratively takes sequence query as object to pass thru wrapper class to the local BLAST, then returns result
	In this class, >> blast[x]_output.txt

3.	Create a dummy dataset (series of fasta files)
